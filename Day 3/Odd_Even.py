'''
Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.

Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.

e.g. 86 is even because 86 Ã· 2 = 43

43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.

e.g. 59 is odd because 59 Ã· 2 = 29.5

if number % 2 == 0 :
