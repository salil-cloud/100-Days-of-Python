# Instructions
# Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by themselves and 1.

# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number

# You need to write a function that checks whether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not.

# e.g. 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2.

# But 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2 or 4.

    if number > 1 :
        for i in range(2, int(number/2)+1) :
            if number % i == 0 :
                print("It's not a prime number.")
                break
        else :
            print("It's a prime number.")
    else :
        print("It's a prime number.")
