# Instructions
# You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall. Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

# number of cans = (wall height x wall width) Ã· coverage per can.

# e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5

# number of cans = (2 * 4) / 5 = = 1.6

# But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the result should be rounded up to 2 cans.

# IMPORTANT: Notice the name of the function and parameters must match those on line 13 for the code to work. 
#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
def paint_calc(height, width, cover) :
    number_of_cans = round((height * width) / cover)
    print(f"You'll need {number_of_cans} cans of paint.")

#Write your code above this line ðŸ‘†
# Define a function called paint_calc() so that the code below works.   

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
test_h = int(input("Height of wall: "))
test_w = int(input("Width of wall: "))
coverage = 5
